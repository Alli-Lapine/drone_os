**Lapinesoft DroneOS** is a "drone" management system for Discord running on the Pixlbot codebase.

#### Drones? What? Like, quadcopters?
* Not quite. Drones in this context refers to "dronified" people. Hypno-drones. Essentially, it's a kink community centered around the fantasy of removal of one's will and replacing it with a hivemind. This bot is a sort of role play aid.
* Explaining what the hypnodrone community is currently lies outside the scope of this project. Suffice to say, do your own research, and come back if you're interested.

#### So what is it?
###### I've never seen one before. No one has. But, I'm guessing it's a white hole.
* DroneOS is a speech control module for Discord, able to modify and enforce such modifications as forcing good little drones to communicate only in predefined numeric code (such as is currently housed in codes.yml in this repository).
